type rules

T(type) = type
T(literal) = INTEGER
T(ident) = ident.type
T(ident[]) = ident.basetype
T(ident.x) = ident.fields().at(x)

T(expression with operators) = T(first non-operator terminal in expression)
                if there is more than 1 non-operator terminal x in the expression and T(x) != INTEGER, this is an unresolvable type
                    because operations are only defined between integers, not on user-defined types or constructed types
